m                   5Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. The needs of data structures include the following: efficiency, reusability, and invisibility. Data structure
 provides a means of organizing


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
- Creation
- Insertion
- Traversal
- Search

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
- Compiler Design
- Operating System
- Database Management System
- Statistical analysis package
- Numerical Analysis
- Graphics
- Artificial Intelligence and Simulation.


what is an Array?
An array is an object that can contain multiple values also It is a non-primitive variable that can hold multiple
values.
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?

Array is for small amount of data;
Array list can have multiple data type;
Array is static(array has to be predefined)
Array list is linear data structure;
Array list data is defined in block(with index only)

what is LinkedList?
Linkedlist is list that is used nodes in order to store the values. The values are not stored in block.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node.

what is queue?
Queue is a collection base on the way the data store inside. First in-first out; Last in-last out.

what is stack?
Last in-First out; First in-last out.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
First in-first out; Last in-First out.

what is the order of complexity?


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
The best case to search an element from an array is Array list, Set and Map.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case to search an element from an array is array list.

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a non-linear data structure.

what is graph in data structure?
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashtable is synchronized whereas HashMap is non-synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
- RDBMS:  Array
- Network data model:Graph
- Hierarchical data model:Trees

How HashMap works in java?
Key value pair.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which
is not present in the array.It occurs when we try to access the elements which are greater than the array length.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Manually; Arrays.copyOf(); System.arraycopy(); Object.clone().

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of objects known as a node.

What is DFS and BFS?
BFS stands for Breadth First Search.
DFS stands for Depth First Search.

What is Recursion?
Whenever a method calls itself to create a kind of loop.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every elements are attached
to its previous and next adjacent. In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically manner
(GRAPH and TREE).

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends
towards a particular value or infinity.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Space Complexity, Time Complexity, O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n2)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
